# Fairness-Based-machine-learning-models

The following notebook covers how regularisation affectsthe accuracy-fairness tradeoff. The main aim of the research is to study model selection taking into account accuracy and fairness metrics. 
It shows how standard machine learning models perform compared to fairness based machine learning models. Two datasets the Adult Census Income Dataset
and the German credit Dataset are being used in the report.
